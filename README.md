Practicing Angular

So far this is our typical workflow when making an AngularJS app:

1. Create a module, and use ng-app in the view to define the application scope.
2. Create a controller, and use ng-controller in the view to define the controller scope.
3. Add data to $scope in the controller so they can be displayed with expressions in the view.

To see the app in browser:
- cd into workspace
- Fire up webserver:
  node web-server.js
- Got to:
  http://localhost:8000/index.html
